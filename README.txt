Project Title: ad Infinitum : you can </not> advance

Description: A procedurally generated endless platformer, where players navigate horizontally
	for as long as possible, before a wall behind them reaches them. As the player moves further,
	the overall selection of "chunks," or slices of level that are concatenated together, becomes
	more difficult, and requires greater proficiency in maneuverability and movement control.
	Incorporates intelligent chunk assembly, and movement mechanics such as pseudo-double jump (jump preservation),
	wall-jumps, and corner jumps (advanced wall-jump)

How to run the project: Open the file FINAL_GAME.py and run it. NOTE: If the synthwave tracks are not downloaded into the project
	folder, do not change the variable songsEnabled at the top. If the tracks are downloaded and present in the folder,
	edit FINAL_GAME.py, and change songsEnabled to True at the very top to enable the radio. You must download all songs if you decide to enable radio.
	
	Optional song download: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1pJsUtyuGRxnfmCUBVcgX8_pWJzFxSu6c?usp=sharing
	Place .wavs into the same project folder that FINAL_GAME.py is in.

Libraries required: cmu_112_graphics, random, math, time, pydub, simpleaudio, numpy, and module manager.
	If modules are not already installed, use module manager--which is included in the project folder--
	on the first file run to install them.

No shortcut commands
